OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:

- **Cultivating meaningful relationships.**  
    By partnering with the city and the community we foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.

- **Inspiring civic engagement.**  
    We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how the city works and inspires them to effect civic change.

- **Empowering Oaklanders.**  
    We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our communityâ€˜s collective well-being.

## How we work

Brigade membership is open to all, regardless of expertise or skill level. We work collaboratively, in the open, and strive to ensure those most impacted by our work are included in the decision-making that shapes it.

### 2022 leadership team

The brigade is managed by a Steering Committee made up of one project representative from each project team, plus four co-leads elected by general membership. As of April 2022, we are revisiting our governance structure to explore how we can make participation easier, more effective, and more inclusive. We do not currently have any elected co-leads.

Current Steering Committee members:

- John Baldo (rep, OpenOUSD)
- Felicia Betancourt/Sean Martinez (alternating reps, Open Budget)
- Elina Rubuliak (rep, Open Disclosure)
- Niels Thorsen/Gabriel Ehrlich (alternating reps, WOAQ)
- Tom Theimer (rep, Councilmatic)
